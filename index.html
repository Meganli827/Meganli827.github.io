      <p class="category-description">Edward Jones is a investment company which focus on individual investors. One of their main promotion method is using direct mail. Customers who received the direct mail could directly buy products through replying to this mail. However, due to lack of filtering of potential customers, the response rate is only about 2%, which means a large amount of cost on sending direct mail is wasted due to no reply. Our job is using the database of Edward Jones to build model, and use our model to find out the customers who have the most possibility to respond the direct mail. Finally our model could help this company reduce their waste on sending non-reply direct mail.</p>
